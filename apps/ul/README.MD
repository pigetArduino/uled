Universal Led Test
-------------------
![ULed python app](https://github.com/pigetArduino/universalLed/raw/master/doc/ul_app.png)

This application doesn't do much things right now    
It allows you to test the leds   
This is a good example to autodetect specific arduino (this was tested with multiples serial devices/arduino plugged)
There are still a lot of room for improvements   

Next version will implement 
* websocket
* pixel detection for custom HUD in games
* file modification trigger (share leds as file using samba/windows share)
* Whatever you want!
